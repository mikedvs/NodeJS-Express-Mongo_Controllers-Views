PORT:
Once a computer receives a packet, hot it knows what program to send it to.

The program is 'listening' on that port, we assign that number that is unique.

socket address ie :3000

By default, most unsecure internet connections are sent to port 80.

NODEJS gives us the ability to specify the port. Map to that port number.
